/**
 * This package contains classes for information Sources, which hold a collection
 * of Layers in the temporal space. There two types of Sources: GridSource and
 * StationSource. Together, these classes define how to effectively fetch and
 * interpolate data that is either gridded or stationary point data.
 * •Note: data fusion (Overrides) and model’s quality statistics only use Station Sources.
