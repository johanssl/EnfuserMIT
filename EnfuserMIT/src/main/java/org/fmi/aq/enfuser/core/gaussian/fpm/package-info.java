/**
 * “Fpm", which stands for Fast Plume Math, is package that is dedicated for the
 * computationally efficient Gaussian dispersion computations.
 * This also includes fast, pre-computed math functions that are frequently
 * used within this framework.
 *
 * •Note: FpmForm that contains an array of FpmCells is involved in one of the
 * most crucial operations in the model: the environmental profiler
 * (emission foot-printing) that is performed for each modelling cell
 * in the area of interest.
