/**
 * ï‚§ This package is for the archiving and loading of model output,
 * for the newer (2019 and onwards) approach of compressed hourly packages in particular.
 * This package takes care that all modelled data with supporting information
 * (meteorology, pollutant concentration with source category separation,
 * measurements and statistics) are distributed as compressed archives.
 * These archives can then be stored to cloud portal and loaded for the processing
 * of final (larger) datasets (e.g., netCDF and videos)
