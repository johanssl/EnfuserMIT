/**
 * ï‚§ This package is dedicated for emission sources, i.e., emitters. All
 * emitters extend the AbstractEmitter which describe the common mechanisms that
 * each emitter should have. The other emitter classes that extend this abstract
 * class, introduce a unique way of describing emission sources
 * (e.g., lines, netCDF, GeoGrid, point sources).
 *
 * Some supporting classes that thematically fit with emitters are also
 * included in this package.
