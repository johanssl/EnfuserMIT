 * ï‚§ This package is for setting up modelling Regions once osmLayers that facilitate
 * the modelling are available on a local archive. The package takes care of
 * setting up files and directory structures for the newly created Regions and
 * also generates default RegionOptions (i.e., the settings for Feeds and modelling areas).
