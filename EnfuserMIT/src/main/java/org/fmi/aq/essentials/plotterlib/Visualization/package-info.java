/**
 * ï‚§	This package is responsible for the creation of single visualization out from a gridded dataset (GeoGrid). The class responsible of this process is the FigureData. For the creation of the visualization, an existing osmLayer can be used to render background features (also the satellite data can be used as background). Meteorological information can also be attached to the output images as symbols.
