/**
 * 	A heterogeneous collection of tools that do not thematically fit into other packages within Essentials. Historically, Essentials was designed to be a stand-alone distributable and therefore several tools provided in this package can have overlap with the similar tools defined in Enfuser packages.
 * 	There are two notable classes of interest:
 * •	Proj handles projections and coordinate transformations (imports Proj4J)
 * •	Sentinel2task is responsible for the extraction and processing of SENTINEL 2 MSI datasets
