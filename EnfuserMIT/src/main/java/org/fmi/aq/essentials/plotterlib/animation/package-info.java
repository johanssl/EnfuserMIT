/**
 * 	Using a 3 dimensional dataset, this package creates a large number of frames (using FigureData) and uses the frames to create an animation. To increase the smoothness of the animation the methods also supports interpolated frames to be generated.
 * •	A video animation can be produced only if the respective addon PLUGIN is available.
 * •	Even if video is not being generated, the Anim class is responsible for the image creation of Enfuser as it iterates over the 3-dimensional emission grids (enfuser.core.FusionOneLiners).  *
