/**
 * ï‚§	This package defines two dimensional datasets in a geographic area (WGS-84 coordinate system, class Boundaries). The datasets can also have time-dependency (Dtime) and can support byte-compression (using offset and a scaler, the value range is represented with 256 unique values). GeoGrid and ByteGeoGrid are the most commonly used internal data structure in the source code for gridded data.
