/**
 * ï‚§	A package dedicated to road objects in osmLayer (RoadPiece). The road information in raw OSM-data can be described literally as pieces of roads, for which the length (m) can vary from 10m to several kilometers. Small RoadPieces can cause a burden for the modelling approach and due to this several methods to bundle and defragment small RoadPieces are provided here.
